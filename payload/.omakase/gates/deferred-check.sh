# Deferred gate: confirm a producer recorded a fresh PASS for the code being
# pushed. The hook does NOT run the check; it reads a record the producer wrote
# in-session (see the sibling bin/omakase-record.sh). For verdicts that
# cannot be computed inside a hook - an LLM judge, a slow flow, a human sign-off.
#
# GENERIC + DORMANT BY DEFAULT. Reads its parameters from env, so a repo that
# declares no deferred check never sees it. Activate from the consumer's
# lefthook.yml `scripts:` entry (same mechanism as adr-required.sh):
#
#   pre-push:
#     scripts:
#       'deferred-check.sh':
#         runner: bash
#         env:
#           OMAKASE_CHECK: visual-verify
#           OMAKASE_GLOB: 'apps/web/* packages/*-control/*'
#
# Env:
#   OMAKASE_CHECK - check name; matches the record + the producer. UNSET = dormant.
#   OMAKASE_GLOB  - space-separated path globs; the gate applies only when a file
#                   in the pushed range matches one. Patterns are shell `case`
#                   globs (a single * spans directories).
#   OMAKASE_BASE  - optional range base. Default: the remote's default branch.
#
# Scope is a HEURISTIC against the local remote-tracking ref, not git's exact
# pushed-ref protocol; it can over- or under-scope on multi-ref / non-origin /
# stale-ref pushes. See ADR 2026-06-02-omakase-deferred-gate-scaffold.
